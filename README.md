# DogeBot web app using Next.JS

This project is the repo for the front- and backend of the DogeBot web app. 
I am new to Next.JS and curious how this plays out. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
